##Details

The Toggle control allows the user to switch an option on or off. You can also combine several toggles into a Toggle Group in cases where only one of a set of options should be on at once.

The Toggle has a single event called On Value Changed that responds when the user changes the current value. The new value is passed to the event function as a boolean parameter. Typical use cases for Toggles include:

* Switching an option on or off (eg, playing music during a game).
* Letting the user confirm they have read a legal disclaimer.
* Choosing one of a set of options (eg, a day of the week) when used in a Toggle Group.

Note that the Toggle is a parent that provides a clickable area to children. If the Toggle has no children (or they are disabled) then it is not clickable.
