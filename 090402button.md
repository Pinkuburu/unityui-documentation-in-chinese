Details

The button is designed to initiate an action when the user clicks and releases it. If the mouse is moved off the button control before the click is released, the action does not take place.

The button has a single event called On Click that responds when the user completes a click. Typical use cases include:

Confirming a decision (eg, starting gameplay or saving a game)
Moving to a sub-menu in a GUI
Cancelling an action in progress (eg, downloading a new scene)
