##Details

Some controls (such as Buttons and Toggles have textual descriptions built-in. For controls that have no implicit text (such as Sliders, you can indicate the purpose using a label created with a Text control. Text is also useful for lists of instructions, story text, conversations and legal disclaimers.

The Text control offers the usual parameters for font size, style, etc, and text alignment. When the Rich Text option is enabled, markup elements within the text will be treated as styling information, so you can have just a single word or short section in boldface or in a different color, say (see the page about Rich Text for details of the markup scheme).

##Hints

* See the Effects page for how to apply a simple shadow or outline effect to the text.
