# GUI Style (IMGUI System)

GUI Styles are a collection of custom attributes for use with UnityGUI. A single GUI Style defines the appearance of a single UnityGUI Control.

If you want to add style to more than one control, use a GUI Skin instead of a GUI Style. For more information about UnityGUI, please read the GUI Scripting Guide.

Please Note: This page refers to part of the IMGUI system, which is a scripting-only UI system. Unity has a full GameObject-based UI system which you may prefer to use. It allows you to design and edit user interface elements as visible objects in the scene view. See the UI System Manual for more information.

Details

GUIStyles are declared from scripts and modified on a per-instance basis. If you want to use a single or few Controls with a custom Style, you can declare this custom Style in the script and provide the Style as an argument of the Control function. This will make these Controls appear with the Style that you define.

First, you must declare a GUI Style from within a script.

/* Declare a GUI Style */
var customGuiStyle : GUIStyle;

...


When you attach this script to a GameObject, you will see the custom Style available to modify in the Inspector.

A Style declared in a script can be modified in each instance of the script

Now, when you want to tell a particular Control to use this Style, you provide the name of the Style as the last argument in the Control function.

...

function OnGUI () {
    // Provide the name of the Style as the final argument to use it
    GUILayout.Button ("I am a custom-styled Button", customGuiStyle);

    // If you do not want to apply the Style, do not provide the name
    GUILayout.Button ("I am a normal UnityGUI Button without custom style");
}
